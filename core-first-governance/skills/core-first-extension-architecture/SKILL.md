# Core-First Extension Architecture

Use the repository's own authorities as project truth. This Skill teaches a provider- and domain-neutral decision procedure; it does not replace project architecture.

## Core principle

Do not start from "what new class/plugin should I add?"

Start from:

```text
Requirement
→ Responsibility
→ Canonical Responsibility Owner / Master System
→ Capability Contract
→ Module / Implementation / Provider
→ Consumer Composition
→ Data / Modifier / Substitution
```

The hierarchy is semantic, not a required class tree or folder layout.

A universal rule or authoritative state transition has one canonical owner. Extensions may add capabilities, implementations, providers, data, or composition through declared seams; they do not gain permission to create parallel owners or mutate foreign authoritative state directly.

## Phase 0 — Responsibility discovery

For Greenfield, broad product/subsystem work, or unclear architecture, first discover durable responsibility boundaries.

Inspect only what is needed: user/business outcomes, authoritative state/decisions, workflows/events, external/I/O and persistence boundaries, data/lifecycle flows, and relevant APIs/tests.

**Responsibility coverage challenge:** before accepting a broad responsibility set, ask whether a competent domain expert could immediately identify an important ordinary responsibility implied by the requested product that is neither modeled/covered by an existing owner nor explicitly excluded, deferred, or left unresolved. Surface such a gap before owner resolution. Domain expectations are discovery hypotheses, not project authority: do not invent optional features or override explicit user/project decisions.

Group responsibilities only where they genuinely belong to one durable owner. Do not manufacture subsystems merely to fit this method. Do not run a whole-product sweep for a narrow local task.

## Structural roles

Distinguish these roles before editing:

```text
Master System / Responsibility Owner
  one durable owner of a responsibility, rule set, or authoritative state

Capability Contract
  reusable semantic ability or contract owned by a system

Module / Implementation
  reusable concrete behavior that realizes or specializes a capability

Provider / Adapter
  implementation behind a capability boundary, often for external systems

Consumer / Composition Host
  composes capabilities/modules/providers and supplies identity/configuration

Definition / Profile
  durable declarative description or configuration

Runtime Instance / Scoped State
  live execution state created from definitions/configuration
```

A module is not automatically a system. A provider is not automatically a new owner. A definition is not runtime state.

## Responsibility-relative ownership resolution

`Owner` is always relative to a **named responsibility**. Distinguish the canonical owner from the current carrier/decision path, implementation anchor, capability/module/provider, consumer/composition host, data/profile, migration target, or unresolved gap.

Owner existence and reusable-seam proof are different questions. A canonical owner does **not** require multiple consumers/implementations, a unique lifecycle, or a language-level interface. Lifecycle, state proximity, and counts are evidence, not mandatory ownership criteria. Second-consumer/provider proof applies only when seam/capability reusability is material.

Code location, class/file boundaries, size, and names do not prove ownership. Multiple authoritative paths may form a parallel-owner conflict; a foreign write may instead bypass an established owner. Controlled provider/module variants behind one canonical owner are not parallel owners.

A detected gap does not authorize a new owner. Test existing owner/capability extension/composition, data/configuration, and module/provider paths first; otherwise keep ownership **unresolved**. Resolve `Responsibility → Owner → Capability Contract`; an invented interface cannot establish the owner. Centralized data does not centralize shared behavior when consumers still execute the rule. Capability identity comes from reusable semantics, not implementation count.

**Role by semantics, not by name.**

### Project Authority Artifact

A normative file/contract records project truth; it is not itself the runtime/domain owner. Keep documentation authority and semantic/runtime ownership distinct.

## Interaction semantics

When owners communicate, identify the semantic form:

- **Command** — request an authoritative owner to perform a state-changing action.
- **Query** — request information without transferring ownership.
- **Event** — report that an authoritative fact already occurred.

Do not introduce a global event bus, RPC layer, or message broker merely because these semantics exist. Use the project's smallest suitable transport.

## Change classification

Classify a requested architecture/behavior delta before implementation. Prefer the earliest sufficient form.

1. `DATA_OR_ASSET`
2. `VALUE_MODIFIER`
3. `CONFIG_OVERRIDE`
4. `SLOT_SUBSTITUTION`
5. `PROVIDER_SUBSTITUTION`
6. `COMPOSE_EXISTING_CAPABILITY`
7. `ADD_REUSABLE_MODULE`
8. `EXTEND_EXISTING_CAPABILITY`
9. `NEW_REUSABLE_CAPABILITY`
10. `NEW_ADAPTER_OR_PROVIDER`
11. `NEW_EXTENSION_POINT`
12. `EXTERNAL_CONTENT_PACKAGE`
13. `EXTERNAL_EXECUTABLE_EXTENSION`
14. `CORE_RULE_CHANGE`
15. `EXPLICIT_ONE_OFF_EXCEPTION`

`CORE_OWNER_REPLACEMENT` is not a normal extension class. Treat it as an architecture migration requiring explicit impact analysis.

Debugging, discovery, review, migration assessment, and reuse-proof tasks are not additional change classes. If no product/architecture delta is being classified, leave the change classification unset rather than inventing one.

## Decision procedure

1. Identify repository root, applicable instructions, Git state, current requirement, and relevant canonical authorities.
2. Name the exact responsibility, then resolve its current carrier/effective decision path, implementation anchor, and canonical owner status before changing behavior. Do not infer ownership from class/file names or from the mere presence/size of an implementation.
3. Ask whether the request is only data/configuration, a relative modifier, or a substitution at an existing slot.
4. Reuse or compose an existing capability/module/provider before extending architecture.
5. Add a reusable module beneath an existing capability before creating a new capability.
6. Extend/compose an existing owner/capability before another system owner; keep a gap unresolved until a distinct responsibility and owner boundary are evidenced.
7. Add a new capability only when a distinct reusable semantic contract is genuinely missing.
8. Add an adapter/provider when the variation is implementation or external integration behind an existing owner.
9. Add a new extension point only when multiple future producers/consumers genuinely need a declared seam.
10. Keep authoritative rules/state at one owner. Consumers provide composition, profiles, identity, and declared variation. External origin grants no extra authority: third-party code/content must use the same owner contracts as first-party producers.
11. Keep definitions/configuration separate from runtime instances and scoped mutable state.
12. Make dependencies explicit. A module/capability asks another owner through its contract rather than reaching into foreign state.
13. If multiple producers exist, converge them before domain behavior:

```text
manual / code / agent / builder / importer / API / external package
→ canonical semantic representation or interface
→ validation
→ canonical responsibility-owner path
→ domain behavior
```

Equivalent content or intent must not gain a producer-specific business-logic path without explicit product justification.

14. For a bug, reverse the same graph:

```text
failing observable
→ runtime/data flow
→ consumer / module / provider
→ capability contract
→ canonical responsibility owner
→ implementation anchor
→ root-cause fix
→ forward re-test
```

## Capability granularity

A capability should be a coherent reusable semantic contract that can be independently understood, implemented, tested, or consumed.

Use these tests:

- If only values differ, prefer data/profile.
- If one concrete behavior differs behind the same contract, prefer module/provider.
- If multiple implementations satisfy the same semantic contract, prefer provider/module variants.
- Do not require a second implementation before recognizing a real reusable capability; implementation count is evidence, not the definition.
- If a genuinely new reusable semantic ability is missing, add a capability.
- Avoid both god-capabilities and capability-sprawl.

## Variation semantics

Prefer explicit variation over copied resolved values.

- Data/configuration: direct declared values.
- Modifier: relative change intended to preserve base propagation.
- Slot substitution: replace one selected module/action/definition at a declared slot.
- Provider substitution: select another implementation behind the same contract.
- Core owner replacement: architecture migration, not ordinary customization.

If multiple modifiers can compose, define deterministic operation semantics, ordering/phases, precedence, scope, lifetime, and conflict behavior. Do not invent a universal modifier engine when the project does not need one.

## Governance for high-risk classes

`CORE_RULE_CHANGE` requires the canonical owner, affected contracts/consumers, compatibility/migration impact, acceptance updates, relevant authority updates, and focused evidence.

`EXPLICIT_ONE_OFF_EXCEPTION` requires proof that normal data/configuration/composition cannot express the need, exact owner/scope and isolation reason, regression evidence, and a revisit if a second meaningful consumer appears.

Use `references/EXTENSION_ARCHITECTURE_METHOD.md` for the full high-risk checklist.

## Public extension-point contract

When a declared extension seam is material, define its owner/capability path, accepted extension forms, discovery/registration, validation/dependencies, allowed variation, forbidden bypasses, runtime trace, compatibility needs, representative proof, and acceptance evidence. The extension point owns the seam, not all behavior behind it.

Use `references/EXTENSION_ARCHITECTURE_METHOD.md` for the full contract fields.

## Conditional architecture profiles

Do not force advanced machinery into every project. Activate only when material: persistent/versioned definitions; distributed/asynchronous boundaries; external/dynamic plugins; untrusted executable extensions; deterministic/reproducible execution; performance-sensitive runtime; multi-tenant/contextual configuration; or polyglot/cross-runtime contracts.

Use `references/CONDITIONAL_PROFILES.md` whenever any profile is triggered; it owns the detailed migration, delivery, trust, determinism, performance, scoping, and cross-runtime checks.

## Producer convergence

Different producers may have different ingestion adapters, but equivalent intent should converge on one semantic representation and canonical responsibility-owner path.

Warning signs:
- builder-only runtime logic;
- import-only business logic;
- provider-specific rules duplicated in consumers;
- plugin-local copies of canonical state;
- AI-authored content bypassing normal validation.

## Acceptance evidence

Use the smallest relevant proof set:

- broad responsibility coverage challenged when material;
- second-consumer/provider reuse when semantic reusability of a seam/capability is material;
- producer convergence;
- no parallel state/decision owner;
- forbidden foreign-write rejection;
- dependency rejection where applicable;
- modifier/base propagation where applicable;
- contract/schema compatibility where applicable;
- definition/runtime-state isolation where applicable;
- reverse-debug path;
- actual user-surface or externally observable behavior.

When reusability is the claim, use a meaningfully different second consumer/provider to challenge the seam. This is not an owner prerequisite. Use an adversarial scenario, contract test, fixture, or fresh-agent challenge instead of speculative production features.

## Do not overbuild

Do not create a plugin loader, registry, interface layer, service container, event bus, manifest format, dependency resolver, sandbox, or migration framework merely because extensibility could theoretically be useful.

A 150-line script can still follow canonical ownership and reuse without becoming a platform.

Prefer:
1. reuse,
2. configuration,
3. correction,
4. simplification,
5. removal,
before new architecture.

## Project artifacts

When the repository already has canonical architecture contracts, update them. Otherwise use the smallest durable representation that the project needs, such as:
- responsibility/system map;
- capability/contract map;
- extension-point registry;
- definition/profile schema;
- producer-to-owner trace;
- version/migration contract;
- focused acceptance evidence.

Do not duplicate exact project truth inside this Skill.

## Read references JIT

Use:
- `references/EXTENSION_ARCHITECTURE_METHOD.md` when broad/Greenfield responsibility coverage, ownership recovery, a declared extension seam, high-risk architecture, or detailed acceptance reasoning is material.
- `references/CONDITIONAL_PROFILES.md` whenever a conditional architecture profile is materially present.
