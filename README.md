# Core-First Governance v0.11.3

Provider-neutral governance for AI-assisted software work, currently packaged as a Codex **Skills-only** plugin.

## What v0.11.3 changes

v0.11.3 is a bounded Core-First architecture refinement from real project/compiler work: broad product or subsystem requests can be locally well-designed yet still omit an ordinary, material responsibility that a competent domain expert would immediately expect. The fix stays inside the existing `core-first-extension-architecture` owner.

### Responsibility coverage challenge

For Greenfield, broad product/subsystem work, or unclear architecture, Core-First now asks before accepting the responsibility set:

> Could a competent domain expert immediately identify an important ordinary responsibility implied by the requested product that was never considered?

If yes, surface the gap before owner resolution and determine whether an existing owner already covers it, it is explicitly excluded/deferred, or it remains unresolved.

This is deliberately **not** a product-archetype compiler inside the plugin:

- domain/product expectations are discovery hypotheses, not project authority;
- explicit user/project decisions, exclusions, and deferrals win;
- the challenge does not authorize a new owner or capability;
- narrow local tasks do not trigger whole-product reconstruction;
- normal Core-First still proceeds `Requirement → Responsibility → Owner → Capability → Module/Provider → Consumer → Data/Modifier`.

### Context cleanup without semantic loss

The main Core-First Skill was close to its context ceiling. v0.11.3 moves duplicated detail to the existing JIT references instead of adding another procedure:

- detailed conditional-profile rules remain in `references/CONDITIONAL_PROFILES.md`;
- the full public extension-point contract and high-risk checklists now live in `references/EXTENSION_ARCHITECTURE_METHOD.md`;
- the main Skill keeps the triggers and non-negotiable invariants.

Result: the main Core-First Skill drops from **14,950 to 14,379 bytes (-571 bytes)** while adding the coverage challenge. No existing Skill family is removed or merged.

## v0.11.2 outcome/debugging baseline remains intact

Outcome-coverage reconciliation, exact symptom identity, evidence-driven debugging, workspace reconciliation, and the complete v0.11.1 ownership semantics are preserved unchanged.

## v0.11.1 ownership baseline remains intact

### Owner existence != reusable-seam proof

```text
Responsibility
→ test existing owner/capability extension/composition
→ resolve canonical Owner boundary
→ define Capability Contract if needed
→ test reusability separately when material
```

The Core-First Skill now states explicitly:

- a canonical owner does **not** require a second consumer, second implementation, unique lifecycle, or language-level interface;
- lifecycle, state proximity, consumer count, and implementation count are evidence, not mandatory owner criteria;
- second-consumer/provider proof is for **semantic reusability of a seam/capability**, not for proving that a responsibility deserves an owner;
- a detected ownership gap does not authorize a new owner; existing owner/capability extension/composition and smaller data/module/provider paths are tested first, otherwise the gap stays `UNRESOLVED`;
- semantic order is `Responsibility → Owner → Capability Contract`; an invented interface cannot manufacture ownership;
- an unauthorized foreign write is not automatically a second canonical owner;
- existing project architecture authorities are updated instead of creating a parallel ownership document by default.

### v0.11 responsibility-first owner resolution remains intact

```text
exact responsibility
→ current carrier / effective decision path
→ implementation anchor
→ canonical owner status
→ capability / module / provider / consumer / data role
→ smallest semantic correction or explicit unresolved gap
```

The v0.11 baseline distinctions remain:

- **owner is responsibility-relative** — class/file boundaries do not define owner boundaries;
- **current placement != canonical ownership** — code location is evidence, not authority;
- **parallel owner != provider variation** — two independent active authorities over the same responsibility conflict, while controlled providers behind one capability do not;
- **unresolved stays unresolved** — do not invent an owner merely to complete a map;
- **data != behavior owner** — central values with duplicated consumer-side rule execution are still duplicated behavior;
- **implementation count != capability identity** — one implementation can realize a real reusable contract, and several implementations can remain variants of one capability;
- **name != role** — `Service`, `Manager`, `Controller`, `Repository`, `Engine`, `Factory`, `Facade`, `Helper`, `Host`, `Renderer`, etc. neither prove nor disqualify ownership.

Detailed God-class/parallel-owner/gap recovery examples live in the existing JIT method reference rather than expanding Governance with a new procedure owner.

### v0.10 behavior remains intact

Evidence-driven hypothesis invalidation/effective-runtime-geometry routing and cheap post-compaction workspace awareness/JIT re-consumption are unchanged from v0.10.0.

## Existing v0.9 surface model remains intact

For material user-surface work:

```text
PROJECT USER-SURFACE AUTHORITY
        ↓
consume before implementation
        ↓
STYLE | STRUCTURE | PLACEMENT | HIERARCHY
SPACING/SCALE | STATES | RESPONSIVE | REFERENCES
        ↓
implementation
        ↓
REAL WHOLE SURFACE
        ↓
OPV against the same applicable authority
```

The agent distinguishes `CONFIRMED | INFERRED | UNKNOWN`; relative guidance stays relative. Optional Working Views/Atlases are disposable interpretation/cache, not authority.

## Context budget

The always-loaded orchestration kernel remains **10,594 bytes**, byte-identical to v0.11.1. The complete owner-local orchestration corpus is **26,042 bytes** (v0.11.1: 25,997; delta **+45 bytes**) under unchanged ceilings of **11,000-byte kernel**, **4,000 bytes per JIT reference**, and **26,500-byte total**.

The canonical Core-First Skill is now **14,379 bytes** (v0.11.2: 14,950; **-571 bytes**) under the unchanged **15,000-byte** ceiling. Detailed conditional/extension-point material moved to existing JIT references rather than being deleted.

## Consumer-tool decision

No mandatory consumer-tool gap is introduced. The observed failures are reasoning/attention/evidence-consumption/context-continuity problems that can be corrected with small JIT Skill guidance plus existing host read/search/runtime/vision capabilities.

No bundled:

- `.mcp.json` / MCP server;
- computer-use stack;
- debugger tool;
- workspace database;
- atlas generator;
- sixth Skill.

## Hard invariants preserved

- Primary agent = orchestrator + final integrator, not dispatcher-only.
- When architecture/ownership/reuse is material, the primary agent **MUST load and apply `core-first-extension-architecture` itself**.
- Current repository/project/runtime truth outranks memory, old plans and derived views.
- Grounded Execution remains `DISCOVERED → INSPECTED → EXTRACTED → MAPPED → CONSUMED`.
- Non-trivial execution remains adaptive and replans on invalidating evidence.
- Existing project routing/index artifacts are reused before broad rediscovery.
- Core-First verifier remains fresh/read-only/two-phase.
- Independent Review remains anti-anchored.
- Project-defined external completion authority remains external.
- Portable Governance remains provider/tool neutral.

## Five Skills

| Skill | Canonical responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `core-first-orchestration` | minimal-context routing, grounded/adaptive execution, outcome-coverage reconciliation, evidence-driven debugging, delegation/completion routing |
| `core-first-extension-architecture` | responsibility discovery/coverage challenge, owner/role resolution, reuse, composition, capabilities/providers/extensions, reverse-debug architecture path |
| `observable-product-verification` | real user/external outcomes, whole-surface fidelity, evidence reuse/traceability |
| `core-first-verifier` | fresh read-only two-phase Core-First conformance |
| `independent-review` | anti-anchored consequential/high-risk review |

## Windows / Codex UI installation

From the extracted release directory:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process Bypass
.\install-personal-windows.ps1
```

The installer copies the plugin to `%USERPROFILE%\.codex\plugins\core-first-governance` and updates `%USERPROFILE%\.agents\plugins\marketplace.json`. Restart the ChatGPT desktop app, install/update **Core-First Governance** from the Personal source, and start a new Codex thread.

## Development rules

- Name the responsibility before declaring its owner; current carrier/name/size does not prove canonical ownership.
- For broad product/subsystem work, challenge whether an important ordinary responsibility was never considered; domain expectations are hypotheses, not authority.
- Owner existence is separate from reuse proof; second consumers, lifecycle, implementation count, or interfaces are evidence rather than mandatory owner criteria.
- Resolve `Responsibility → Owner → Capability Contract`; do not let an invented interface establish ownership.
- One canonical owner per durable responsibility; keep unresolved gaps explicit until evidence supports a path.
- Data centralization is not behavior convergence; implementation count does not define capability identity.
- JIT detail must be explicitly routed; context optimization may not weaken semantics.
- Negative evidence must invalidate dependent hypotheses, not merely add another note.
- Do not identify visual/runtime sources from resemblance or matching visible size alone.
- After context loss, discover current workspace state cheaply before JIT loading; never hydrate everything by default.
- Working aids remain cache and reuse existing discoverability/routing mechanisms.
- A local fix never replaces the original requested outcome boundary; completion is based on outcome coverage, not passing-evidence count.
- Preserve reported observable identity; nearby defects remain separate until causal identity is established.
- Do not add consumer tools merely because the host/plugin format supports them.
- Re-run release + host validation after Skill/manifest changes.
